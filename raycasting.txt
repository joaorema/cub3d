Ray Casting Process: The main ray casting process in render_rays works as follows:

For each ray (NUM_RAYS total):

-Calculate the ray angle based on player's angle and FOV
-Perform both horizontal and vertical checks
-Compare distances to find the closest wall hit
-Project the wall slice based on distance and angle


Wall Hit Calculation: When a hit is found (either horizontal or vertical):
The hit position is stored in hit->hit_pos
Distance is calculated using the distance formula:

distance = sqrt((bx - ax) * (bx - ax) + (by - ay) * (by - ay))
The closest hit (between horizontal and vertical) is chosen:

Wall Rendering: Once a wall hit is found:
The wall height is calculated based on distance
The correct texture is chosen based on which side was hit (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)
The wall slice is drawn with the appropriate texture
This implementation uses a DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) approach for both horizontal and vertical ray casting, which is efficient for grid-based maps. The raycaster calculates both horizontal and vertical intersections and chooses the closest one to ensure accurate wall detection.

The project also includes optimizations like:
